# Reporting Functional Issues
There are certain classes of behavior outlined on our program policy page which do not represent any relevant CVSS impact. 

We are still interested in hearing about functional issues through other existing channels.

If you would like to report functional issues to us, please send an email to `support@shopify.com` with the following subject:

```
[Bugbounty Functional Issue] <enter the title from your report>
```

Please provide all relevant details provided to us in the report via the body of this email.

Note that behavior reported via this channel is in no way associated with the Bugbounty program.

Thanks for hacking on Shopify!
